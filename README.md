## React commits app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

My versions are:
- npm: 6.4.1
- node: v10.12.0

To run the project locally open a console and run:
- ```git clone https://github.com/fergom/commits-react-app.git```
- ```cd commits-react-app```
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start```

Then, open your browser on localhost:3000 and the app will be running there.

## Scripts
